<h1> Space Oddities </h1>
University of Bucharest | Web Course Project

This website features a fully responsive design, it implements GLSL shaders as hero screens. The page is meant to read like an article to discover interesting things about space.

There are also quizzes at each section which also feature responsive design. The quizzes utilize AJAX promises to fetch the quizz data depending on which quizz button was pressed back in the main page.

On the final section of the article, there is a small gravity simulation game which uses canvas to draw the screen, the simulation is made to run on discrete time steps and the trajectory predictions are done also by simulating discrete time steps into the future.
